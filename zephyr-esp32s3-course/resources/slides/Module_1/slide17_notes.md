# Slide 17 Notes

## How to Navigate Zephyr Documentation

- Start with the Zephyr docs site: guides, API refs, and board pages.
- Use search plus the sidebar to jump between subsystems, samples, and APIs.
- Keep local docs via `west build`’s generated API reference when offline.

## Key idea

Knowing where to look in Zephyr’s docs saves time and prevents rework.

## Narration

Zephyr’s documentation site is organized by guides, API references, and board-specific pages. Use the search to jump to drivers, subsystems, or samples that match your problem. Board pages list supported features and required configs. When working offline, you can generate and consult local API docs from the source tree. Building a habit of quick navigation—search, sidebar, and board pages—helps you answer questions fast and avoid guesswork.
