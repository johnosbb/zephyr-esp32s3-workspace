# Slide 2 Notes

## Where Zephyr Comes From?

- Born from the merger of two RTOS projects: Rocket RTOS and Wind River’s Microkernel.
- Adopted by the Linux Foundation in 2016.
- Designed as a modern alternative to legacy RTOS systems with stronger security, modularity, and tooling.

## Key idea

A modern, unified RTOS built to replace fragmented legacy systems

## Narration

Zephyr did not appear out of nowhere. It has its roots in two earlier real-time operating systems that emerged in the 1990s and 2000s: Rocket RTOS and Wind River’s microkernel. 
These projects had already been used in embedded environments, and Zephyr inherited a lot of the experience and lessons that came from them.

In 2016, the project was adopted by the Linux Foundation. 
That move was important, because it brought Zephyr into a neutral, open governance model with backing from many different companies. 
Instead of being tied to a single vendor, it became a community driven RTOS with a clear long term vision.

From the beginning, Zephyr was designed as a response to the limitations of older, legacy RTOSes. 
Those older systems tended to be more fragmented, harder to extend, and not always built with modern security and tooling in mind. 
Zephyr aims to fix that by offering stronger security features, a highly modular design, and a much cleaner development experience.

So the key idea here is that Zephyr is a modern, unified RTOS that was created to replace a fragmented world of legacy systems with something cleaner, more secure, and easier to build on for the future.


## Voice Over for Animated Timeline

Phase 1 (0-8 seconds)
Slide: The Proprietary Foundation (1990, 2014, 2016 Feb)
The roots of Zephyr are found in the powerful embedded systems kernels of the past, specifically the Virtuoso RTOS from the 1990s. In 2001, Wind River Systems acquired Belgian software company Eonic Systems, the developer of Virtuoso. Critically,  in November 2015, Wind River Systems renamed the operating system to Rocket, made it open-source and royalty-free.

Phase 2 (8-16 seconds)
Slide: Linux Foundation & Open Source (2016 Feb, 2016 Sep, 2019)
In February 2016, the Linux Foundation officially adopted the codebase, forming the Zephyr Project under an open-source license to ensure vendor neutrality. The first stable release, Zephyr 1.0, followed in September 2016. This foundation paved the way for the major Zephyr 2.0 release in 2019, which introduced better modularity and initial multicore support.

Phase 3 (16-24 seconds)
Slide: Growth and Industry Standard (2021, 2024, Current)
By 2021, the project had matured into a self-sustaining ecosystem with hundreds of contributors, demonstrating its industry traction. In 2024, Zephyr launched its third Long-Term Support release, guaranteeing years of maintenance for enterprise systems. Today, Zephyr is a secure, scalable, and community-backed RTOS, rapidly becoming the standard for modern connected devices.
